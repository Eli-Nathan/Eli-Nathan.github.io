  Whether you're writing a report for Uni, or trying to figure out how to fix that spreadsheet or simply trying to win an argument, this handy guide will help to get the search results your need.
</p>

<h3>1: Omit certain results</h3>

<p>
  This is my most used "Hack" for searching through the millions of results found when performing a search.
</p>

<p>
  You might think: "Why would I not want certain results to come up?" Well, one example would be:
</p>

<p>
  You may be trying to create a spreadsheet on a certain program other than Excel. However, every time you search for "How to fix my spreadsheet", the results that show will ALL be aimed at people using Excel. So to omit all the results that contain the
  word "Excel" you'd simply type a "-" symbol before the word you'd like to get rid of. So now your search would be:
</p>

<p>
  "How to fix my spreadsheet -excel"
</p>

<p>
  Cycle through the two images below to see the difference in searches.

  <div class="col-sm-6">

    </h4>
    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/google-excel1.jpg" alt="Examle of results full of Excel related pages" class="img-fluid" />
  </div>
  <div class="col-sm-6 pt-1">
    <h4>
      <strong>After:</strong>
    </h4>
    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/google-no-excel.jpg" alt="Examle of results without Excel related pages" class="img-fluid" />
  </div>
