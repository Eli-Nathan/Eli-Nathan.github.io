<h3>The terminal</h3>
<p>Most developers and designers use the terminal everyday but it can be tough to learn all the pre-written aliases that speed things up for you.</p>
<p>
  I'll go over some of the aliases and techniques I use to speed things up a bit ðŸš€
</p>

<section>
  <h3>Assumptions</h3>
  <p>I'm on OSX and using <a href="https://brew.sh/" target="_blank">Homebrew</a>, <a href="https://ohmyz.sh/" target="_blank">ZSH</a> and <a href="https://www.iterm2.com/" target="_blank">iTerm2</a> as my terminal.</p>

  <h4>Install Homebrew</h4>
{% highlight shell %}
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
{% endhighlight %}

  <h4>Install iTerm2</h4>
{% highlight shell %}
brew cask install iterm2
{% endhighlight %}

  <h4>Install ZSH</h4>
{% highlight shell %}
brew install zsh
{% endhighlight %}
</section>

<h3>Out of the box</h3>
<p>Now that you have these three things installed, it is already easier to do a lot of stuff</p>
<h4>Homebrew</h4>
<p>As you saw above, installing applications is really simple with Homebrew. It's also as easy to update and remove them.</p>
<h4>ZSH</h4>
<p>Now that you're using ZSH, <code>auto_cd</code> will be enabled by default.</p>
<p>This means that instead of typing <code>cd mydir/anotherdir</code>, you can omit the <code>cd</code> altogether.</p>
<p>Tab completion should also be set up so if you start typing a command or a filepath, hit tab and options will be shown to autocomplete your command.</p>
<h4>iTerm2 themes</h4>
<p>You can customise iTerm2's themes so that they look pretty cool:</p>

<p>Check out <a href="https://gist.github.com/kevin-smets/8568070" target="_blank">this link</a> for instructions on how to style yours.</p>


<h3>Aliases</h3>
<p>You may find yourself typing the same commands over and over again, maybe even a sequence of commands.</p>
<p>Aliases allow you to write your string that will perform any given command.</p>

<p>Now that you're using ZSH, in your home directory (<code>cd ~</code>) there will be a hidden file <code>.zshrc</code>.</p>

<p>Open that file:</p>
{% highlight shell %}
open ~/.zshrc
{% endhighlight %}

<p>In there you'll see a bunch of config code, most of it commented out. Have a look through it to see if there's anything in there you'd like to enable.</p>
<p>Once you're done, scroll right to the bottom and you'll see some aliases.</p>
<p>You'll now be able to write your own aliases using the following syntax.</p>
{% highlight shell %}
alias myaliasname = "command(s)"
{% endhighlight %}

<p>My own <code>.zshrc</code> file looks like this:</p>

{% highlight shell %}
# Set personal aliases, overriding those provided by oh-my-zsh libs,
# plugins, and themes. Aliases can be placed here, though oh-my-zsh
# users are encouraged to define aliases within the ZSH_CUSTOM folder.
# For a full list of active aliases, run `alias`.
#
# Example aliases
# alias zshconfig="mate ~/.zshrc"
# alias ohmyzsh="mate ~/.oh-my-zsh"

alias installRun = "npm i && npm run dev"
alias ls = "ls -a"
alias share = "php -S '10.54.4.120:3000'"
{% endhighlight %}

<p>You'll can see my <code>installRun</code> alias contains more than one command that I've strung together using the <code>&&</code> operator.</p>

<h3>Git</h3>
<p>I find the built in alias <code>gcam</code> particularly useful when commiting files to my git repositories.</p>
<p>It means that instead of writing:</p>

{% highlight shell %}
git add .
git commit -m "My commit message"
git push
{% endhighlight %}
<p>I can simply write:</p>
{% highlight shell %}
gcam "My commit message" && gp
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Some other useful built in aliases that speed up your git workflow:</p>
{% highlight shell %}
# Check the status of your working tree 
gst [git status]

# Pull from origin
gl [git pull]

# Push to origin
gp [git push]

# Switch to branch
gco <branchname> [git checkout <branchname>]

# Switch to new branch
gcb branchname [git checkout -b <branchname>]

# Push new branch and set origin to a new branch of the same name
gpsup [git push --set-upstream origin $(current_branch)]

# Fetch origin
gfo [git fetch origin]

# Stage all changes
gaa [git add --all]

# Commit with message
gcmsg "Your commit message" [git commit -m "Your commit message"]

# Stage and commit everything in your working tree 
gcam "Your message here" [git add --all && cit commit -m "Your message here"]
{% endhighlight %}

<p>The list of git aliases is huge so it's worth looking them up to decide which are most useful to you.</p>

<p>Have fun!</p>
