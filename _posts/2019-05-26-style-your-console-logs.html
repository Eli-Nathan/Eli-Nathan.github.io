<h3>But why?</h3>
<p>
  Why might you want to style your logs? Well it could be an innocent reason like Facebook (go have a look) or many companies who put a message there to try to drum up some recruitment leads for their development team...
</p>
<p>
  It could also be cos you're a <strong>dick</strong> that wants some extra developer points. Like me 👀.
</p>

<h3>How?</h3>
<p>When writing your console log, your first argument (which is usually just the text/variable you want to output) needs to contain "<code>%c</code>". For example: <code>console.log("%c Hello world!")</code>.</p>

<p>The second argument, must be the CSS you want to use to stye your log. For example: </p>

<pre><code class="language-js">console.log("%cHello world!", "background-color:#137886; color: white; padding: 5px; border-radius: 3px; font-family:verdana; font-weight:bold; margin: 20px;")</code></pre>

<figure>
  <figcaption>Your styled <code>console.log()</code> should now look like this:</figcaption>
  <img src="/assets/images/log.png" alt="Styled console.log" class="img-fluid" />
</figure>

<p>You can keep adding to that so that different parts of your log have different styling but using more than one <code>%c</code> and more than one styling parameter.</p>
<p>Like so:</p>

<pre><code class="language-js">console.log("%c( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) %c¯\\_(ツ)_/¯", "background-color:#137886; color: white; padding: 5px; border-radius: 3px; margin: 5px;", "background-color:#861340; color: white; padding: 5px; border-radius: 3px; margin: 5px;")</code></pre>

<figure>
  <figcaption>Result:</figcaption>
  <img src="/assets/images/log2.png" alt="Another styled console.log" class="img-fluid" />
</figure>

<p>Have fun!</p>
