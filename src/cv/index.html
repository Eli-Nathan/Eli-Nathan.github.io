          <p>Web designer / Freelance Web Developer seeking full time employment as a front-end web developer within an organisation.</p>
          <p>I am currently working full time for Arnold Clark as a web designer. Being part of this team has been a great and fulfilling experience. I came here from being a freelancer in order to gain experience as part of a large team, working in an agile environment.</p>

          <p>Now that I have more of this experience I am looking to further my skills in a development centered role.</p>

          <h2>Skills summary</h2>
          <hr />
          <p>Throughout my time as a freelancer and as a web designer I have gained a broad range of clients and completed a diverse list of projects.</p>
          <p>Most of my experience is with front-end development using technologies such as HTML, CSS (along with SCSS/SASS), JavaScript, JSON, jQuery and the Bootstrap framework.</p>
          <p>More recently I have been creating React components which I have enjoyed learning.</p>
          <p>I am capable of creating and maintaining workflows using tools such as Gulp, Webpack and Grunt. Through these skills I have also shown my understanding of the command line.</p>
          <p>I have expanded my skills into back-end development using technologies such as PHP, MySQL and AJAX to run server-side scripts instantly. I am well experienced in database creation, management and normalization.</p>
          <p>More recently my job has required me to write small amounts of Ruby which I managed to pick up quickly as most back-end languages follow a similar syntax and logic flow.</p>
          <p>As a freelancer, I have experience in the entire web development process from initial meetings with clients, through the design process right up to testing and uploading to the client's chosen server.</p>
          <p>As well as extensive experience with the technologies mentioned above, I capable of using design software such as Adobe's Creative Cloud package. My day to day consists largely of using Sketch and Invision too.</p>
          <p>I have recently worked with a few clients that have required development to existing WordPress plugins and themes and I am now confident in my understanding of the CMS.</p>
          <p>With all of these skills, I am able to write my code cleanly, efficiently and properly managed by using version control on Github.</p>

            HND Interactive Media: Web Development

            <span class="location">City of Glasgow College</span>
            <br />
            <span class="grad">Graduated June 2016</span>
          </h3>
          <p>I graduated from the City of Glasgow college with an A grade in my HND in web development. Here we learned the basics of web design and some of the core languages used in web development. Within my own work, I had already learned the majority
            skills taught on this course but I benefitted from certain subjects such as XML, MySQL and PHP which I had not yet found time to learn.</p>
          <p>This course culminated in a large project which entailed creating a website for a fake client based on a real company. The brief consisted of creating both the front-end and back-end of their new website by following their existing branding.
            As the requirements for the project were fairly simple and lacked a sense of challenge, I greatly expanded the project to include more advanced features such as a booking system, custom built mailing list system and analytics as well as a
            multi-level login system for admin and general users.</p>
          <p>During my course, as the only student with industry experience, I was often asked to help others with their learning. I value my ability to learn new things quickly and I'm always more than happy to help others.</p>

          <p>At Arnold Clark, my day to day consists of designing and building web pages and applications in an agile environment. While my current job is a mixture of design and development, my main skillset lies in the more technical aspect of my role. Having the most from my time as a freelancer, I am the “go to guy” in our team for front-end jobs. Here I also help maintain our own CSS framework and introduced utility classes which our team now use.</p>

          <p>I began my own company as a sole trader in November of 2015. I have built myself a respectable client base and portfolio. I spend time speaking to potential clients and outlining the services I can offer which cover most aspects of front-end web development. I hand-code all my websites and I have a lot of experience using Bootstrap. My current client base ranges from small to medium sized businesses and some international clients. </p>

          <hr />
          <p>I have had too many great clients to talk about each individually. My website contains a select few projects but there have been many more, especially from my latest job role.</p>
          <p>Please don’t hesitate to get in touch if you’d like to see any more examples of my work.</p>

          <h3>Past Experience</h3>
          <p>Before becoming a web developer, I had a lengthy and successful career as a chef. I worked for three years through small restaurants and hotels and then went on to work as a chef at the five star Gleneagles Hotel. As a chef, I gained a strong work ethic and team working skills as well as a keen eye for detail which has helped me greatly in my design work.</p>

          <h3>Personal Interests</h3>
          <p>I recently completed a round the world trip after leaving my job at Gleneagles. During this trip, I had adventures such as travelling through India on trains, picking apples and living in a campervan in New Zealand, staying on islands in Malaysia and Fiji and climbing mountains in Peru. Aside from travelling I enjoy socialising, playing video games and of course I love to write code. I often spend my free time creating online applications in order to further my skills.</p>
